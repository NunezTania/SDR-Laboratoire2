// Test idea

// 1. CREATE an event and do LISTM, check that the new event is there

// 2. CREATE an event, ADD a staff, LISTU and check that the staff was added to the event

// 3. ADD a staff to an event he already is in, check that the users is on the new post and was erase from the old post

// 4. CREATE an event with a post capacity of 1, ADD a person, answer = the person was added, ADD an other person, the answer = "Could not add user to post because post is full"

// 5. CLOSE an event with the authentification of the owner, answer should be = "Event closed"

// 6. CLOSE an event with the authentification of someone else than the owner = "Event couldn't be closed"

// 7. CREATE an event with the wrong authentification, answer should be = "Authentication failed"
